#Dr Quang
I was an orphan who was adopted by a rich family because i had the highest score.[p]
Since childhood, i was raised to inherit the family’s hospital, i had to be the best at everything. I was a little nobody in a world of giants.[p]
I felt small and lonely.[p]
Most of all i grew to believe that no one would want me if it’s not for the benefit that i could bring to them.[p]
And so i risked everything to chase fortune, till the day i achieved all the wealth i dreamed of yet no one to share it with.[p]

I was a man who could save lives yet can never excuse myself as a good doctor.[p]
I never put heart into listening to the patients, i never put heart into anyone around me.[p]
Even now, lonely on my dying bed, this old guy had no one to blame but himself because he wasn’t there for his loved ones when they needed him either.[p]

All the wealth and talents i possessed and yet nothing mattered when i didn't choose to share it with anyone. When i realized it, it was already too late.[p]
