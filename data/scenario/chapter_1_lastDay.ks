In the next few days, Lan started coughing blood. She doesn't want to meet anyone, throws away her wedding dress, stops taking chemical therapies and doesn't even want to eat anymore.[p]
Minh doesn't leave her side even just for  a minute. Gradually, Lan gets better, she starts talking to Minh.[p]

You know, at first you were like a chicken losing its head as a nurse too.[p]
But you worked harder than anyone else to get better. You took your time talking to everyone, you shared the pain with the patients,...[p]
One time you almost collapsed for overworking yourself after donating too much blood, just because we ran out of type AB.[p]
You're not the best at everything but you put so much heart into it and made everyone change their opinion about you.[p]
Especially us at the charity fund department who barely got any active nurse.[p]

Depends on how much you think you have done in your whole life. This is your final judgement day.[p]
You managed to have a choice because you've done more good than bad and heaven determines that you're a white soul.[p]

I was a weak child since birth.[p]
I waited years and years at the orphanage to have someone to call mom and dad yet no one came because i looked sick and skinny.[p]
Then Minh came to the orphanage after his parents got death sentence for murder.[p]
We cleaned the kitchen together because we were the eldest. The two kids no one wanted to talk with, dreaming about a day when we can run far away from this place[p]
open a restaurant where we can cook everything we want and never get hungry again.[p]
I always love his food and Minh said i had a much bigger appetite than what i looked like[p]

I want to cook from morning to night and see people's faces get brighter by enjoying my food. I want to see Minh's smile when he's working.[p]
I want to go to the altar with him, wearing my wedding dress and swear the vow. I want to have kids and give them the parental love i have never received in my entire life.[p]
